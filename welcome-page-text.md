genTile is a pipeline, primarily intended for internal use in the Lappalainen lab, for designing CRISPR guide RNAs with optimal spacing for CRISPRi/a applications. It extracts sequences from target genomic regions, designs candidate guides, and selects high-scoring guides with appropriate spacing for effective tiling.
